assets should be kept to 32-bit or lower (this is more an aesthetic
choice than anything, so feel free to break this rule if it'd make 
for a better experience!)

the microgames themselves fit within a 216x144 window styled on the 
gameboy advance screen. raw visual assets should fit within this 
window to minimize storage of large assets. scaling in-engine is
fine, just keep in mind the pixel-perfect nature of a game with this
low of a resolution in order to minimize artifacting.

fontmeme is a great site for fonts as well as fontstruct.

mono sound preferred but not a necessity--positional sound will
need to be introduced in microgames that require them as the 
globals sfxplayer and musicplayer are non-positional (but do accept
stereo tracks and will play them as such). sfx are defined as short,
one-shot sounds (not designed to repeat, you will have to play them
again manually). these should be in .wav format to maximize quality.
music is longer and generally designed to be repeatable, these tracks
should be in an .ogg format to minimize load times.
