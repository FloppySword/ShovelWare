none of these are enforced by the engine, these are purely for legibility.

if an object exists purely in code, use snake_case. if an object exists outside 
of code (eg., an asset) use PascalCase. for references in code to 
ANonCodeObject, the references should also be snake_case. when referencing an
object created in code that exists outside of code, its variable should be in
snake_case while the object itself should be PascalCase (eg.,a 
SceneThatIsReferenced and held in a_variable, or AnyNode that is created in code
and added to the SceneTree)
blame godot's style guide for this mess ^ i just inherited it

all CONSTANTS, including ENUMS, should be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. pretty standard.

a _private_method, _virtual_method, or a _parameter_that_goes_unused should have
a leading underscore (the debugger will throw a warning but not an error.)
