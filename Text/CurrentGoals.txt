add a tv static shader for when you zoom into and out of the game

refactor the title screen and the splash to take place on the deanboy

refactor popit and petthepet to properly take advantage of the starting
and stopping...

popit still needs the win state logic set up, could also use different
flight paths (circular, sinusoid, wavy, etc)

make sure the sfx and music are mono not stereo* and bitcrush them!

looks like you can still do inputs when the microgame should be ending
(the bomb explodes) and not sure if this is good or not. sounds not good?
so make sure to add a way to toggle taking mouse input on/off in microgameshandler
