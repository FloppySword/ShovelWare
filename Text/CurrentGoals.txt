add a tv static shader for when you zoom into and out of the game

refactor the title screen and the splash to take place on the deanboy

create a base microgame class with the basics (init, start_game, 
end_game(end_state)

refactor popit and petthepet to properly take advantage of the starting
and stopping... petthepet seems to start music even without prompting

make sure the sfx and music are mono not stereo* and bitcrush them!

need to make sure that the microgame only "starts" when the game is 
done zooming in (looking at you petthepet!!!)
