scenes should have their own folders, a subfolder for scripts, and a subfolder
for assets unique to the scene

RAW assets go into res://Assets/.RAW (this is not visible from within godot, use
system file manager to find it.) this is where you place .blend files, .aseprite
files, etc. and they will not be exported with the project but will be tracked
by git. game-specific assets go in their respective scenes folder, reusable 
assets go into res://Assets/*.

a great resource for realistic photos is pexels.com, no attribution required for
those--try to modify them as we don't want giant hi-res images. would encourage
using things we don't have to attribute but making stuff ourselves is also good
so long as we don't spend way too much dev time on it
